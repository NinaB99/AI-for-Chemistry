# Oral bioavailibility prediction using mashine learning

This project aims to create a machine learning model that can predict the bioavailability of molecules. Several types of models are tested, including a feed-forward neural network, a graph neural network, a random forest model, an XGBoost model and a features neural network.

All our code can be found in the Code folder.

The data files are in the Data folder.

The required packages are listed in requirements.txt
